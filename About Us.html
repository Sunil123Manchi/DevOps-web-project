        <h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
        <p>
            DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. The goal of DevOps is to improve collaboration between development and operations teams, automate processes, and enhance the overall efficiency of software development and deployment.

            <h3>Jenkins</h3>
            <p>
                Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their software. It supports continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
            </p>
            <h4>Use Cases:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Automating the build process</li>
                <li>Running tests after every commit</li>
                <li>Deploying applications to production environments</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="tool">
            <h3>Docker</h3>
            <p>
                Docker is a platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring consistent environments across multiple stages of development and deployment.
            </p>
            <h4>Use Cases:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating development environments</li>
                <li>Microservices architecture</li>
                <li>Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="tool">
            <h3>Kubernetes</h3>
            <p>
                Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a framework for running distributed systems resiliently.
            </p>
            <h4>Use Cases:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Managing containerized applications at scale</li>
                <li>Automating application deployment and scaling</li>
                <li>Self-healing applications with auto-restarts, replication, and scaling</li>
